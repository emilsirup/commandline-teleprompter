# Commandline Teleprompter

Are you in desperate need of a teleprompter that can only run in your terminal? Well, in that case, you're in luck!


## Run the program

Locate the directory you've downloaded the project in, and run the main.py file in the terminal
```
    py main.py -f <input txt file> -s <how many seconds the teleprompter will take> -tc <titlecard (optional)>
```
PS: If you want to have spaces in your titlecard, add quotes around it.
## Usage/Examples
```
    py main.py -f C:\Users\47983\Desktop\foobar.txt -s 60 -tc "Hey Jude"
```
To start the teleprompter, press space.

If the program isn't functioning, try to import keyboard with pip.
```
    pip install keyboard
```
